I'm working at becoming more profient in form generation and integrating different types of files, conditions, and methods into the code. I have successfully generated a .txt file that userData is stored, I created 
a password randomizer, if a username is entered for login it will be shown on the schedule form, otherwise it will be a generic "welcome".  I also allowed for user passwords to be shown.  

I still hope to add the following:
formatting the DOB and phone number to match a consistant format.  
storing username and password for database retrieval
creating a calendar on the signup page

Cleaning up the forms and making them more appealing.
